# FAIR Assessment Summary (Pre-DOI)

This repository provides a FAIR-ready contribution for the NASA PCoE lithium-ion battery aging dataset (ARC29–ARC32). The FAIR assessment follows the original FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and is conducted using an evidence-based audit approach.

The assessment applies to the FAIR-ready contribution only, including metadata, schema definitions, ontology mappings, provenance descriptions, and documentation. No data transformation or data redistribution is involved.

## Findable

The repository provides structured, machine-readable metadata and citation information to support discovery and attribution. A persistent identifier (DOI) has not yet been assigned at the current pre-release stage. This limitation reflects the current publication status rather than a deficiency in metadata quality.

## Accessible

All FAIR-ready resources in this repository are publicly accessible through an open, standard web protocol. The original NASA PCoE experimental data are not redistributed and must be obtained directly from the official NASA source under NASA’s access conditions.

## Interoperable

The metadata are expressed using formal, machine-readable formats and are aligned with community-recognized vocabularies and ontologies, including BattINFO and QUDT. Explicit schema definitions and ontology mappings are provided to support semantic interoperability.

## Reusable

Clear licensing (CC BY 4.0) is provided for the FAIR-ready contribution. Detailed provenance information, variable definitions, and contextual documentation support transparent interpretation and reuse of the metadata and semantic resources.

## Scope and Limitations

This FAIR assessment applies exclusively to the FAIR-ready contribution contained in this repository. The original NASA PCoE data remain outside the scope of redistribution. The Findable principle will be fully satisfied once a persistent identifier (DOI) is assigned in a future public release.

This summary is intended to provide transparency without assigning FAIR maturity levels or quantitative scores.
