# FAIR Assessment Scripts

This directory is intentionally left empty.

FAIR-related aspects in this work are assessed qualitatively and
evidence-based, as described in the accompanying paper and documentation.

No quantitative FAIR scoring tools, maturity models, or automated FAIR
assessment frameworks are implemented or provided in this repository.

This design choice is consistent with the methodological scope of the study,
which focuses on transparent documentation of FAIR-relevant artifacts rather
than on numerical compliance evaluation.
