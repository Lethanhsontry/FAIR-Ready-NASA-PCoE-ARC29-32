# ETL Scripts

This directory is intentionally left empty.

Although the FAIR-ready contribution described in this repository involved
controlled data extraction and restructuring steps, full end-to-end ETL
pipelines are not distributed here.

Consistent with the repository-level data redistribution policy, no scripts
that generate or export measurement-level data files are provided.

The focus of this repository is on metadata curation, schema design, physical
sanity checks, and evidence-based FAIR assessment, rather than on reusable
data ingestion or transformation pipelines.
