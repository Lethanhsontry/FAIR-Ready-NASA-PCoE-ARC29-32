    NASA PCoE Lithium-Ion Battery Aging Dataset – ARC 29–32 Subset

  version: v0.1.0

  description: >
    This record describes FAIR-oriented curation artifacts derived from the NASA
    Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) Lithium-Ion Battery Aging ARC dataset,
    focusing on cells B0029 to B0032 (ARC 29–32). The curation includes deterministic
    extraction and tabular serialization into three Parquet tables (cycles,
    measurements, and impedance), evidence-based physical sanity checks, and the
    creation of machine-readable metadata (schema, variable dictionary, provenance,
    and ontology alignment). No experimental data files are redistributed in this
    repository.

  methodology: >
    The source dataset originates from controlled laboratory experiments conducted
    by NASA PCoE to study lithium-ion battery aging behavior. The raw MATLAB data
    structures were inspected to identify hierarchical organization, cycle indexing,
    operation types (charge, discharge, impedance), and available measurement fields.
    The processed Parquet artifacts were then validated via evidence-based physical
    sanity checks to verify plausibility and internal consistency of voltage, current,
    temperature, capacity, and impedance signals.
