    This file provides standardized definitions of all variables included
    in the NASA PCoE Battery Aging ARC 29–32 standardized subset. Variable
    names, data types, and descriptions are derived from direct inspection
    of the original MATLAB (.mat) files and are organized according to the
    designed table schemas.
