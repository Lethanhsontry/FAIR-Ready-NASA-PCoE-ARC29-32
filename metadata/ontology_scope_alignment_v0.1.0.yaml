ontology_scope_alignment:
  version: v0.1.0

  purpose: >
    This document defines the scope, constraints, and alignment principles
    for ontology mapping applied to the NASA PCoE Battery Aging ARC 29–32
    subset. It serves as a binding specification for subsequent variable-level
    ontology mapping and prevents speculative or unjustified semantic assignments.

  evidence_basis:
    - schema_design.yaml
    - NASA PCoE README (ARC 29–32)
    - Raw data inspection logs
    - Physical sanity check analyses

  ontologies_in_scope:
    QUDT:
      role: >
        Authoritative ontology for physical units and quantity kinds.
      usage_policy:
        - Mandatory for all variables with confirmed physical units.
        - Unit IRIs must be selected strictly based on NASA documentation.
        - No inferred or assumed units are permitted.

    BattINFO:
      role: >
        Domain ontology for battery systems, experimental cycles,
        and electrochemical measurements.
      usage_policy:
        - Applied only when a one-to-one semantic correspondence
          with NASA documentation is confirmed.
        - No deep class hierarchy mapping is required at this stage.
        - Parameters derived or estimated by NASA are mapped cautiously
          or left unmapped if no canonical term exists.

    BDF:
      role: >
        Supporting vocabulary for common battery data concepts.
      usage_policy:
        - Used selectively when variable names and semantics
          directly match BDF definitions.
        - Not mandatory and never enforced.

  mapping_scope_by_table:
    cycles:
      semantic_entities:
        - BatteryCell
        - ExperimentalCycle
        - OperationType
      unit_mapping:
        - ambient_temperature_C: DegreeCelsius (QUDT)
      exclusions:
        - Cycle-level time vectors are not mapped to absolute timestamps
          due to MATLAB date vector representation.

    measurements:
      semantic_entities:
        - Measurement
        - ChargeOperation
        - DischargeOperation
      unit_mapping:
        - Voltage: qudt:Volt
        - Current: qudt:Ampere
        - Temperature: qudt:DegreeCelsius
        - Time: qudt:Second
        - Capacity: qudt:AmpereHour
      constraints:
        - Charger-side and load-side measurements are treated
          as distinct physical quantities.
        - No derived performance metrics are introduced.

    impedance:
      semantic_entities:
        - ElectrochemicalImpedanceMeasurement
      unit_mapping:
        - Current: Ampere
        - Impedance: Ohm
        - Ratio: Dimensionless
      constraints:
        - Estimated parameters (Re, Rct) are not reinterpreted
          beyond their definitions in NASA documentation.

  out_of_scope:
    - FAIR maturity assessment
    - Data transformation or ETL processes
    - Derived health indicators (SoH, RUL)
    - Predictive or analytical modeling

  enforcement_rules:
    - Any variable lacking explicit evidence from NASA documentation
      must remain unmapped or marked as unknown.
    - Ontology mappings defined in subsequent steps must comply
      with this specification without exception.

  notes:
    - This document is valid only for dataset version v0.1.0.
    - Updates require creation of a new versioned scope document.
