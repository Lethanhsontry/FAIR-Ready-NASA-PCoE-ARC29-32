provenance:
  dataset_version: v0.1.0

  description: >
    This provenance record documents the actions that have actually been
    performed on the NASA PCoE Battery Aging ARC 29–32 subset for the
    current dataset version. The scope of this version includes deterministic
    extraction and tabular serialization into Parquet artifacts, evidence-based
    physical sanity checks, and the creation of machine-readable metadata and
    schema documentation. No modification, interpolation, or correction of
    experimental measurements has been applied.
  
  
  source_data:
    origin: NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE)
    dataset_name: Battery Aging ARC (subset ARC 29–32)
    raw_files:
      - B0029.mat
      - B0030.mat
      - B0031.mat

  source_note: >
    The original MATLAB files are used as source inputs for curation
    but are not included or redistributed in this repository.

    data_format: MATLAB (.mat)
    acquisition_method: Experimental laboratory measurements

  processing_steps:
    - step_name: Raw data structural inspection
      description: >
        Inspection of the hierarchical structure of the original MATLAB
        files to identify cells, cycles, operation types, and available
        measurement fields.
      evidence: Python inspection logs and structural summaries

    - step_name: Physical sanity checks
      description: >
        Verification of physical plausibility of voltage, current,
        temperature, capacity, and impedance measurements based on
        representative cycles.
      evidence: Documented sanity check analyses

    - step_name: Schema design
      description: >
        Design of table-level schemas for cycles, measurements, and
        impedance data based strictly on observed raw data structures.
      evidence: schema_design.yaml

  data_transformation:
    performed: false
    description: >
      No data transformation, preprocessing, cleaning, filtering, or
      format conversion has been performed in this dataset version.

  derived_variables:
    performed: false
    description: >
      No derived variables or computed features have been created.
      All variables correspond directly to fields present in the
      original raw MATLAB data structures.

  data_filtering:
    performed: false
    description: >
      No data records have been filtered, removed, or excluded.
      All raw data entries have been retained.

  licensing:
    description: >
      The standardized dataset inherits the usage conditions and licensing
      statements provided by the original NASA PCoE dataset documentation.
      No additional license is imposed in this version.
